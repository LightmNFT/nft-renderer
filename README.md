# Lightm NFT Renderer

This project is used for providing a page to render any NFT based on [RMRK](https://rmrk.app) standard.

In this way, we could help display RMRK NFT on classical NFT marketplace like Opensea.

## Run locally

- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`

> Note: Do not try to update `next.js` version, it's confirmed that `next@^13.4` will cause a constant object in `@pixi/core` become empty after `npm run build`.
